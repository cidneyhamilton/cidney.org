Alon and I got married a year ago today. We had a traditional Israeli wedding in T-shirts and jeans at City Hall in Queens, after eight years of dating and not being able to be in the same country for more than a couple months. I've now been living with them in Berlin for about a year, and looking into the process of permanent residency in Europe.

I got handfasted to a different partner (in a Pagan ceremony) a year before that, for a year and a day. That didn't work out. Last I heard my ex-wife had moved in with someone else and seemed to be doing okay. But I have no way of really knowing.

I've been married twice and engaged four times at this point. As a lot of things-- a child of a divorce, a feminist, someone generally socially progressive-- it's hard to take marriage seriously. At the same time, I wasn't prepared for other people's reactions. Partners tend to treat me differently after becoming engaged or married. Friends and family have strong feelings about it. And certainly it's necessary for us to live together.

For now, though, I don't want to be cynical.

Tonight we're going to do a jigsaw puzzle and potentially go out to play board games, and I'm going to do my best to be happy.
