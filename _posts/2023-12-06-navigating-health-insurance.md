This month, I've been trying to figure out how to obtain health insurance in Germany.

I've been here since early spring, but didn't get my visa approved until August. As the spouse of a German citizen I didn't need health insurance for a visa; however, now that I'm living here, I need insurance.

I've been unclear about whether or not I can get on the Kasse (German's statutory health insurance system); apparently as an American I'm not eligible because I've never been on something similar. My options if I continue to freelance are to try to apply for the KÃ¼nstlersozialkasse (subsidized health insurance for artists) or to go through the private insurance system. 

Right now, I'm doing a combination of solo indie game development and contract programming for clients. If I made enough to support myself just working on my own games I might be eligible for the KVK, but right now, all of the freelance work I'm doing is too technical. I'm trying to look into private insurance. Since everyone in Germany needs to have health insurance, they allegedly can't say no.

I've never been able to get private insurance in the past due to pre-existing conditions, and I'm honestly terrified of applying. The last time, when I tried getting expat insurance before Alon and I got married, I had to list every single doctor visit I'd ever had in my life. I'm a Munchausen by Proxy survivor. I had daily doctor's appointments in high school. Most of that was fabricated; my life and health got much better when I stopped having a relationship with my birth mother. But it's still something health insurance underwriters care about.

America's cruelty towards people who are sick or injured is a meme. If I slipped and fell on ice tomorrow and had to go to the hospital, I'd have to pay a lot out of pocket-- but it would still be less than what I'd have to pay with insurance in the US. I'm still dealing with rescinded payments related to my injuries after a catastrophic car accident nearly ten years ago. These are bills that were paid years ago, that are clearly not my responsibility-- but default to me beause my insurance company thinks another insurance provider might be responsible. It's exhausting and time consuming to deal with in the best case; exhausting in the worst case.
