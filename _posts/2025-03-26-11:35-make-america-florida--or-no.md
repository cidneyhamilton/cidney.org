I'm back in the US after three months in Germany. This time it's very much just a visit, not going home.

I've had a residence permit in Germany for a year and a half now, but didn't get health insurance until the middle of last year. The next step is figuring out how to relocate my microbusiness. I don't have a German bank account yet. I don't have any European clients and have never been paid in euros. Most of my time these days is going into making City of Glass, which realistically will take another two years before I need to worry about VAT and such. I am at the point where it would help to hire contractors. There are game dev meetups and communities in Berlin, but I don't really know anyone here. I'm dealing with pretty severe depression.

But my spouse does not want to move to the US, and at this point would not be safe there. This is unlikely to change. The US is actively frightening for queers and immigrants, and anyone dependent on the current social safety net that may be going away. Or not. On the individual level we have to plan for the worst. 

Richard Murphy [implies](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/03/23/trumps-assault-on-the-usa-seeking-an-explanation/) (h/t [Alex Schroeder](https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-03-25-down) that most probably outcome is not that American will become fascist in the way that Florida has, but that the federal government will be be reduced to the point that individual American states will have to take up the slack. This is reassuring when it comes to civil liberties, but the economic and environmental impacts... I don't know how to mitigate the damage there. I don't mind the US growing poorer or less relevant. If I get a proper tech job again I would feel much better helping build European alternatives to American tech infrastructure than building more of the usual bullshit and tech fad chasing. But nothing's certain enough to predict. In the meantime, the fear is paralyzing.
