I'm a bit ambivalent about whether I want to share this much here. But continuing with the trend of listing *stuff I did*...

Gamedev:
- 13 hours of consulting on [Stereotypical](http://stereotypical.pages.dev)
- More design work for unnannounced solo project
- Posted that I needed additional programmer for game I'm doing with friends; got great responses
- Followed GDC and NotGDC
- Trying to figure out what's going on with AdventureJam. A new adventure game engine I'm using would like to participate to show off its capabilities-- but not clear if there'll be one in 2024.

Learning:
- Continuing to follow [Draw-A-Box](http://drawabox.com)'s curriculum for learning to make my own environment art for games. Received official critique on lesson 4 (insect constructions).
- Very little time for 3D modeling, but modeled a cute low-poly duck for [Blendsday](https://blendsday.art/)
- Continuing to review flashcards for German vocabulary. Ordered the official A2 textbook. DW's tests say I'm ready to move onto B1, but... skeptical there.

Website:
- Weighing whether or not to add webmentions, to support brid.gy federation and other syndication. More on this later.
- 1 new blog post.

Personal:
- Medical checkups at New York clinic.
- A lot of legwork sharing German phone number and contact information with American bureaucracies.
- Found apartment to sign lease for in Berlin next year.
- Purim celebrations locally.
