[Narrascope](https://narrascope.org/), a small conference dedicated to narrative gaming and interactive fiction, is [open for registration](https://narrascope.org/pages/registration.html) for this year's event!

It'll be at the Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. The first event
took place on-campus at MIT, but then COVID hit, and IIRC the campus
is still closed to the general public. It'd be nice to have it in a
more tourist-oriented hub like Boston or New York, but venues there are very expensive!


[Andrew Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Plotkin) has
been doing most of the organizing, but also on top of everything he's
doing for the [Interactive Fiction Technology
Project](https://blog.zarfhome.com/2024/02/departing-iftf-board),
including IFComp and more. It's a bit too much, and unless someone
else steps up as con chair, there's unlikely to be another event in
2025.

I've met some really cool people through Narrascope ([Dave
Gilbert](https://www.wadjeteyegames.com/), [Francisco
Gonzalez](https://www.grundislav.games/), [Jess
Haskins](https://thegameeditors.com/), etc), and it's how I got
exposed to the AdventureX community, which was a major source of
social support during the pandemic. I would be sad if it didn't run
again.

If anyone's interested in helping out more, feel free to contact
[narrascope@narrascope.org](mailt:narrascope@narrascope.org) directly
and offer to help out. The [IF Tech
Foundation](https://iftechfoundation.org/) also has a [mailing
list](https://iftechfoundation.org/contact/mailing-list/).
