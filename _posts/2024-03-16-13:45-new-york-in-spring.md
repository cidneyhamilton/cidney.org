I'm in New York this month for the first time since October. It's been three days so far. I've been busy wrapping up some contract work at a cofee shop in Queens, but am able to catch up on errands I can only do in the US.

I'm going to need to figure out a lot of things this year. It'll be my first time filing taxes since getting married. I need to figure out health insurance. I need to figure out what continent I'm going to live on. I've been in Berlin for a year and barely know anyone; my freelance clients are all in the US, as are my friends. My partner's lived all over, and in a way so have I, but mostly along the Eastern US.

Now that I'm married, getting health insurance in New York isn't as trivial. But at least I'm in the system. Everything is so complicated. Do I focus on technical work for financial security, or go all-in on creative work and treat programming as incidental to that?

More when I know it.
