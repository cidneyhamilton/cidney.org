I took some time this afternoon to set up categories on my blog. Most posts now belong to an appropriate category, and category indices can be viewed, although not prettily.

This is in conjunction with segmenting my fediverse presence into [work](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@cidney), [life](https://social.cidney.org/@cidney), and [art](https://mastodon.art/@cidney). I could potentially add separate accounts for other software things, non-interactive fiction writing, gaming, and local New York and Berlin things, but going from one to three accounts seems to be enough.

This became necessary when dealing with bereavement. People were posting obituaries before she even was dead! Not a good thing to wake up to in the morning when I'd still been planning on virtually visiting her in the hospital.

I'd have thought that this would make my life more complicated, but it actually makes it easier. All three feeds make me happy in different ways. I can disengage from the work one when I'm not working, and use it as a virtual water cooler to keep me energized when I am. It's making me feel good about using fedi again. 

In a similar way, I am trying to be more mindful about posting here first and syndicating to social media. I still have use Facebook more than most people my age because I'm connected with game industry alumni a generation or two older than me, and people in that age category typically want to use Facebook. But it's a horrible place. Maybe I can set up a page and get someone else to manage it for me. That would make my life easier in a lot of ways.

In the mean time, I have separate RSS feeds for City of Glass devlogs, personal updates, and other things. Hoping to have time at the next IndieWeb meetup to make it more user-friendly. Once upon a time I didn't think I had enough content to participate meaningfully! Now I have plenty of content. It's just not terribly organized.
