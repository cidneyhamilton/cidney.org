title: End of an Era: A Personal Update
date: 2022-12-31

Towards the end of last year, I resolved to [emit more
light](/2021/10/26/emitting-more-light.html); to share more of myself with more
than a handful of other people. Then the events of last year pushed me in the
opposite direction; closing myself off and sharing very little. I haven't
updated this blog since the beginning of the year; and my microblog has largely
been neglected.

In November of 2021, I made the decision to get handfasted to the person who
saved my life after my broken spine. We had been living together in Florida for
four years at that point. I'd spent two years recovering from spine surgery;
then another two years locked down due to COVID. I had planned to move to New
York with her sometime in the early 2020s.

For reasons I did not want to go into, this did not happen. More than a year and
a day since the handfasting, I'm grateful that Cat remains a friend and a
presence in my life, but we are no longer continuing as romantic or domestic
partners.

I moved to New York in August on my own, and am rebuilding a life for myself.
Florida has retreated into my past. I'm still working on a final round of
revisions for my gothic novel, _Elisabeth_, set in Florida, but otherwise, I do
not intend to revisit things. 

Onward.
