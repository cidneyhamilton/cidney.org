Today I released a new game! [Arctic Blast](http://cidney.itch.io/arctic-blast) is available on Itch.io and playable for free in the browser.

[Al Eufrasio](http://www.eufrasio.com/) (King's Quest 7, Leisure Suit
Larry, Quest for Glory) designed the game and did most of the art; I
just programmed it. It's something we were playing around in our spare
time when working on [Summer Daze](http://summerdazegame.com) years
ago. We finally slapped a logo on it and put it out there.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/cidneyhamilton/ArcticBlast). Feel free to [let me know what you think](https://cidney.org/contact/) if you play it.
