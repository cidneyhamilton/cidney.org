I'm about to visit New Hampshire for a few days for my stepmother's birthday. When she and my father started dating, she was a medical doctor in a pediatric surgical subspecialty and on call at three different hospitals in North Florida. She retired last year. My father is still working, but nearly 80. Maybe he'll slow down soon.

I was explaining to them how difficult it's been to apply for a visa for my spouse. My stepfather (also born in Europe) became a permanent resident right after my parents got divorced and my mother remarried. In Europe there are more steps; I have a temporary residence permit for three years, and can renew it or get permanent residency aftre that, provided I have the requisite levels of health insurance (currently I have international health insurance) and language proficiency (B1 vs A1). Before we got married, I could visit Europe for 6 months out of every year on a tourist visa.

Family members of American citizens (spouses, children) don't need to know any English for the application, but the fees are almost $1000, and the process takes 2 years if the family member isn't already in the United States. And things at the border have been scary lately. Even before 2016, I've had extended family turned away at the border when visiting from Europe.

Not many Americans are talking about immigration in the context of criticizing the current administration. We are talking about ICE, AbolishICE, etc. But other countries have border security and checkpoint too. That isn't the issue. It's the level of xenophobia, condescension, and incuriosity towards foreigners in general, migrants or not.

I don't even know what continent I'll be living on in six months. I wish I did.
