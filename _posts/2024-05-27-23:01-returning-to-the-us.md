I've been back in New York for about a week now. [My partner](https://pedestrianobservations.com/) and Iare separated. We still love each other and plan on remaining friends.

I wouldn't consider myself hardcore childfree (in that I'd be open to
being a stepparent or dating someone with kids), but very much don't
want my own. Alon very much wants someone to have kids with and I want
to support them finding that.

We'd negotiated this before getting married, and agreed to wait until
this year to decide. If I had had an easier time assimilating to
Berlin I may have stayed there permanently.

This is still obviously quite hard.
