I've been back in New York for nearly two weeks now.

I am trying to return to work this week. It is not easy. I've never lost anyone I've been this close to, and I don't know how much time off is appropriate. I'm catching up with emails, but wouldn't trust myself to touch my own code. At least I feel like a functional human.

I've gone through all five stages of grief, along with shock and trauma, very rapidly in the last month. It's been a lot.

I've had some people be very supportive ([Scott Adams](https://www.msadams.com/index.htm), [Ken Williams](https://www.kensblog.com/), and [Christopher Sacchi](https://christophersacchi.com/) in the adventure game community); various MIT friends and colleagues who did not know my friend personally; her sibling and parents; and my family and poly chain have all been very supportive. 

There were a lot of people who knew and worked with her, and a lot of
people trying to process someone dying so young and so suddenly. And a
lot of shitty marketing dudes taking advantage of the situation. I
don't really think the "adventure game community", as it was, deserved
her. It's not a community. It's a consumer goods market. It's a danger
to think of it as anything else. The only way to win the game is to not play.

I am wrapping up a freelance web design project. I am submitting my original work to contests and it's not going well. I even changed my occupation with my bank from "programmer" to "writer", since it's looking like I won't ever be looking for work again as a software engineer, and am only programming to support my own personal projects and my business clients', and I'm still fortunately able to be selective about my clients. I would like to have more breathing room to make art-- finish editing my novel, finish the second draft of my novella, finish City of Glass, continue to release shorter works and games-- but the world is moving at a very fast pace.

I turned 38 last week. I feel ancient, like I've seen so much. Yet I don't look any different than I did when I was 15, and I'm not taken any more seriously now than I was then. Does anyone not have a Cassandra complex these days?

It's probably time to delete corporate social media and move my projects off Github. Unless I absolutely have to contribute to a repo for a project I care about that's hosted there by someone else. I am not sure yet.
