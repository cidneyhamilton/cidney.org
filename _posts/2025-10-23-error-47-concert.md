How can we not talk about family when family's all that we've got? 

Everything I went through, she was standing by my side. The School for Heroes extended universe games, the Advent remake with Ken and Roberta fucking Williams, everything. I was trapped and isolated half a world away and only just made it out to the Pacific Northwest to be with the rest of her friends and family to pay respects.

Watch the whole thing on a live screen if you have time-- it's an epic experience on many levels. Even if you don't know her, it shows who she is and was as a person and is an incredible piece of digital poetry in its own right. She gets the Valkyrie sendoff and the honors she deserves, and it's awesome. I can't imagine a better tribute to Roberta Vaughan or a better concert. 

Everything's ephemeral... and it's been a long week. I am tired, jet lagged, and still unpacking from Portland. We'll see each other when we see each other.
