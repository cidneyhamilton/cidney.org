I've deleted my Mastodon instance and am running a different
ActivityPub server instead. Follow me at
[cidney@social.cidney.org](http://social.cidney.org/@cidney).

I've been meaning to check this out since
[GoToSocial](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial) came
out of alpha Impressions so far: so lightweight! So easy to set up. I
need to use a client to post or read, but it's nice not to have to
worry about clearing my instance cache. Maybe someday I could consider
hosting for other people?
