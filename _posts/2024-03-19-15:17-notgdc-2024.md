[GDC](https://gdconf.com/) began yesterday and is running all week. I'm not going, but I'm starting to pay attention to [NotGDC](https://notgdc.io/), an unconference running the same week. GDC costs $2500 for an all-access ticket and runs into all kinds of issues stemming from that; NotGDC is free.

Some (text-based) submissions I've enjoyed so far include:

- [Game Jam Insights](https://medium.com/@hexenwerk/game-jam-insights-7386af975116) by [Hexenwerk](https://www.hexenwerk.dev/). Unfortunately it's on Medium, which is quite inaccessible! It's a very beginner-friendly talk on making the most of being part of a game jam. The author recommends participating in a team to get a feel of what it's like in the industry; I only started doing game jams after I'd shipped a commercial game and wanted to get a break from high expectations and collaboration! Maybe I should try a gamejam with a team someday.

- [Behaviour Trees vs State Macines](https://queenofsquiggles.github.io/guides/fsm-vs-bt/) by [Queen of Squiggles](https://blobfox.coffee/@queenofsquiggles) goes into handling NPC AI using a differnt model than finite state machines. I've been just about to research best practices, and have been delaying because I don't want to deal with [that kind of AI](https://illusion.baldurbjarnason.com/), so someone being self-aware of the problem and compiling an article with plenty of resources into where to go next is quite helpful.

- [How to Think About History in Your Games](https://exilian.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=6845.msg154214#msg154214) by [Jubal](https://hcommons.org/members/jubalbarca/) has a high level approach of how to use history in games, from the perspective of a historian/indie game dev hobbyist. I'm making a historical game right now and am at the point of wanting to reach out to academics familiar with the time period, so I personally found this encouraging!

More available from the [website](https://notgdc.io/). It's running until March 22nd.
