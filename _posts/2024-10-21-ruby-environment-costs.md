I have a new development laptop! This means my company still owns two
backup ones that need to be donated or otherwise given away. One isn't
ergonomic, the other sustained some damage that makes it difficult to
charge. My newest is a [Thinkpad X13](/uses), which is lightweight enough to use on the subway seamlessly on my way to work.

This means provisioning a new development environment. Since I'm doing consulting in Unity this mostly is Mono, PlasticSCM for version control, and everything needed for the editor itself. [Eliza](https://eliza.sh/2022-07-31-using-unity-editor-with-emacs-(part-2).html) has documentation on integrating Emacs with Unity (which involves nontrivial things like installing JetBrains Rider and using a shim). I've been overwhelmed for the last few months on a lot of things, and today was the first time I had a chance to install Ruby and set up a development environment there.

I've never worked as a professional Ruby on Rails dev (though I've used other website backends I like less), but I still use Jekyll and Ruby for this website. This means I don't need to install Ruby unless I want to update the website, and then I have to deal with the very un-fun nature of ruby versions and dependencies. So I've been putting things off on this website and considering redesigning it. I like having things to share in IndieWeb meetups. I just don't have a lot of time.

I like [Louie Mantia's approach](https://lmnt.me/blog/how-to-make-a-damn-website.html) to just make a damn website without using a site generator or anything. I miss all the joy that I used to have in web development, and since going into gamedev I've been out of touch with front-end. I've never used React except for toy projects. The front-end ecosystem looks like a giant mess that's fallen apart with the AI fad. But I have all this history in place for syndicating comments, etc. 

Should I make more time to work on my website? Restyle it for the next year, maybe? Blog more regularly? I definitely want to move my dev blogs to my game's website, and possibly have a more visual-focused portfolio. Do an unrelated project in Ruby to stay up to date? (I've contributed to FOSS projects such as AO3 and Intercode in Ruby but nothing recently.)

In any case, I have a local dev environment for my website, and it'll be easier to blog in the future.
