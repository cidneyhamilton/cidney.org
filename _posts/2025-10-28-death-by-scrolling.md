My primary social media home is the fediverse. I would like to delete everything else. I am open to suggestions for making people move, that aren't getting doxxed or having Twitter bought out by Elon Musk. I am not sure I am up to hosting a server for other people, though. My own is enough. 

Most indie developers I know are primarily active on Twitter and BlueSky and reliant on it for marketing. Screenshots, etc. For a while the only other adventure game developer on the fediverse was [Ron Gilbert](https://grumpygamer.com/).

Who recently released a new game, Death by Scrolling, with [Elissa](https://eigenmagic.net/@vampiress) and other fedi developers. It's available as of today on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_by_Scrolling/), with console ports coming soon, and from dropping into livestreams the music and gameplay are absolutely awesome. 

I did not do any work in this game or have any ties to its success whatsoever beyond a general sense of community pride and good wishes for the developers for getting their project out in the open. I mostly work with Sierra alums. But where there's mourning, there's also joy.

Congrats to Terrible Toybox for making this happen. <3
