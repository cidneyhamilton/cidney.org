I made a short Twine game earlier this year! It's called Flight; it has
one choice; and it simulates the decision to leave, or not leave, a
toxic relationship.

It's been entered in the IF Short Games Showcase for 2024, since I've
been too lazy and disorganized to keep track of more appropriate
gamejams.
