It's a bit late to announce, but I made a train station! Specifically, I made a video game level based on [Alon Levy](https://pedestrianobservations.com/)'s proposed redesign of New York's Penn Station with artist [Emily Compton](https://thiefrabbit.com/), who I worked with on Colossal Cave 3D adventure. The end result is very solarpunk-- it's what Penn Station would look like with a more efficient design and development process.

It's playable [here](https://cidney.itch.io/fantasy-penn-station). Alon gave a webinar on it last week that's been recorded and posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZCqnzc-v3Q), with a recap available [here](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2023/09/29/our-webinar-and-penn-reconstruction/). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/cidneyhamilton/FantasyPennStation).

I started playing with this in December, in part as an excuse to practice 3D modeling. Then in March Alon's research group saw it and liked it, and we got a grant to hire Emily and work on something worth showing off. It's meant to be extendable-- in an early version I had a minotaur wandering around downstairs. Maybe a gamejam for railfan? We will see.
