Just realizing that 2025 posts weren't being linked to on the [blog index](/blog). Fixed. I need to deal with tags and permalinks someday soon. Maybe it'd be easier to get rid of Jekyll and just do the simplest static site possbile. But whenever I look into this, I never get anywhere. Jekyll works, and gives me an excuse to use Ruby.

Maintaining an indie website is *exhausting* with all the various crawlers. I need to get more involved in the indieweb community. Have a number of blog posts I'm behind on. But very tired. Mourning a friend's death, returning to New York to see my father, and trying to figure out how to survive under the current world, have all been a lot.

Israel/Palestine continues to be in my thoughts constantly. I'm not literate in Hebrew or Arabic, and can only follow Haaretz and other English speaking news outlets, and talk to my spouse's family. Why do American Jews use it as a proxy for their own issues? It seems so obvious, but for most Americans, the rest of the world isn't real or worth caring about. End the occupation... respect human lives... put Bibi in the Hague along with Putin and the rest of these brutal authoritarians. I feel so burned out and powerless.

At least my friend has Ozzy Osbourne and Tom Lehrer to keep her company in the afterlife. It's so reminiscent of Carrie Fisher's death and the wave of musicians who left at the same time. But doing my best to stay alive. Broken hearts can be lethal.

More when I have the energy for it. We have the same birthday (tomorrow), and it is going to be rough.
