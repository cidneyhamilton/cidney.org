I'm back in Berlin, and had a chance to spend some time off-and-on at [A Maze](https://2024.amaze-berlin.de/). I didn't know much about it going in, beyond that there's a local games festival.

I didn't end up staying that long-- the venue space seemed to trigger
migraines. I'm also still dealing with "wait, WTF am I actually
*doing* in Berlin", and not having much connection to anything but my
partner.  But the games I saw seemed *very* cool, and ranged from
artsy things to narrative.

One workshop I went to was on solarpunk-- designing games for a hopeful future. I've just finished judging [Spring Thing](http://www.springthing.net/) entries (check out [Social Democracy by Autumn Chen](https://red-autumn.itch.io/social-democracy) if you have not already-- alternate play as SPD in the late Weimar Republic and attempt to prevent Hitler's rise to power with 20/20 hindsight). I've been playing more IF in general. And I've been struck by how dystopian most of the games are. Even when the plot is a cute queer love story, anything near-future is set in a backdrop that seems hopelessly bleak. Even bleaker than I tend to imagine (one theme I keep seeing is regression of queer social rights and enforcement of cishet patriarchy. Given how much better things are now than they were when I was a kid, and how much Florida seems to be an outlier that the rest of the world is horrified by, I'm fairly optimistic about this continuing to get better in the future, but... not everyone is, and that's frightening. It takes effort just to imagine a better world, and getting to a place where we're not crushed by the existential horror of the planet being on fire. 

One thing I certainly hope we can move for is making games that have less... stuff. Less waste. No proprietary handheld devices with planned obsolescence. More openness to modding and collaborative storytelling. Using technology to facilitate the kind of collective storytelling we do with tabletop roleplaying games, not merely to create pretty animated movies with the illusion of player agency.

The game I'm working on is set in the past, though, and is distilling into being a much more straightforward narrative game than I originally anticipated.
