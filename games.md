I make video games! Mostly with Unity, though I've also done some indie stuff with Godot, Inform, or plain vanilla JavaScript and Python. I'm a fan of free and open source gamedev tools for narrative design, such as Ink and Twine.

I'm primarily a programmer, but I've also done 2D and 3D art, animation, music composition, game design, script writing, sound, voice acting... all the things.

Some commercial games I've worked on:

* [Summer Daze: Tilly's Tale](https://summerdazegame.com)
* [Colossal Cave 3D Adventure](https://www.colossalcave3d.com/)
* [Bubble Bonk](http://bubblebonk.com)
* [Hero-U: Wizard's Way](https://cidney.itch.io/wizards-way-prototype)
* [The Clinic](https://cidney.itch.io/the-clinic)
* [Dryad's Quest](https://cidney.itch.io/dryads-quest)
* [Chosen One](https://cidney.itch.io/chosen-one)
* [Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption](http://hero-u.com)
* [The Owl Consults](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=32u49mceyst7p8ey)

My solo indie stuff is available on [itch.io]({{ site.itch-url }})
