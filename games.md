I make video games! I started a game studio called Cat and Witch Games. I use Unity for consulting but my games use free software for the engine and related tools. 

A not-complete list of games I've worked on:
* [Summer Daze: Tilly's Tale](https://summerdazegame.com)
* [Colossal Cave 3D Adventure](https://www.colossalcave3d.com/)
* [Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption](http://hero-u.com)
