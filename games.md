I develop video games! My studio is <a
href="https://catandwitchgames.com/">Cat and Witch Games</a>. I use
free software tools whenever possible.

A not-complete list of published games I've worked on that you can buy or play for free:

* [Summer Daze: Tilly's Tale](https://summerdazegame.com) for Transolar Games
* [Colossal Cave 3D Adventure](https://www.colossalcave3d.com/) for Cygnus Entertainment
* [Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption](http://hero-u.com) for Transolar Games
* [The Owl Consults](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=32u49mceyst7p8ey) for IFComp with Nick Mathewson and Thomas Mack
* [The Clinic](https://cidney.itch.io/the-clinic) for Ludum Dare
* [Dryad's Quest](https://cidney.itch.io/dryads-quest) for Ludum Dare 
* [Chosen One](https://cidney.itch.io/chosen-one) for AdventureJam

For my senior project in high school I designed two play-by-post RPGs, Ashara Online and Euronyme, neither of which are playable, but can be found if you dig deeply enough through the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). I've also designed and run theater-style [live action roleplaying games](https://www.interactiveliterature.org/NEIL/whatIsLARPToUs.html) and tabletop RPGs. My preferred genre has a mixture of narrative and roleplaying/character building mechanics.
