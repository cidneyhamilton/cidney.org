### Game Development

* I'm a big fan of free and open source tools. The recent [Unity](https://unity.com) fiasco should validate this. I still use Unity for client work but prefer [Godot](https://godotengine.org) for my own projects.
* [Ink](http://inklestudios.com/ink) for branching dialogue and narrative design.
- [Krita](https://krita.org/) for 2D art and animation.
- [Blender](http://blender.org) for 3D art
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) for programming, creative writing, and technical writing. I'm recently become a big fan of [GDScript mode](https://github.com/godotengine/emacs-gdscript-mode) for game dev.

### Hardware

* I develop on a ThinkPad E15, which seems to strike a balance between accessibility, power, and cost.
* I use a [Yahama P-45 digital piano](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/) for composition, and just playing music.
