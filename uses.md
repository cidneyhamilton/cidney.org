### Programming Languages

* I've mostly been developing games with [Unity](https://unity.com/) these days, since it's easier to find collaborators familiar with those tools.
* But that's not the only thing I do! Lately I've been spending more time with [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), and native web things.
* For back-end web stuff, I'm most familiar with Python and Ruby. This website is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### Software

* I use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) for programming, creative writing, and technical writing. 
* For graphics, I mostly [Krita](https://krita.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I've been playing around with Aseprite lately for pixel art, with other tools as needed.
* These days I primarily use [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) as an operating system.

### Hardware

* Since late 2021 I've been developing on a [Framework laptop](https://frame.work/). I've found it less useful for EDS-related issues because the keyboard is so small; I have to plug in an additional mouse and keyboard to avoid injuring my hands!
* I use a [Yahama P-45 digital piano](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/) for composition, and just playing music.

### Self-hosting

* I self-host my cloud storage, personal git forge, IM server, and social media hub on [http://city-of-glass.net](http://city-of-glass.net). I began experimenting with [YuNoHost](https://yunohost.org/) towards the end of 2020 to make this less painful, and haven't gone back. I still occasionally host other things for experimentation and geekiness, but nothing I've tried to make stable.
