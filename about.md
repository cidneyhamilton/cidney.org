I'm a designer, writer, and software engineer with about 20 years of
experience, mostly in web and game development. These days I mostly
make narrative games, with <a href="http://kensbook.com">a</a> <a
href="https://infamousquests.itch.io/">wide</a> <a

href="http://www.msadams.com/index.htm">of</a> <a
href="https://www.hero-u.com/">cool</a> <a
href="https://robertasbook.com/">people</a>. Some of my games have
been submitted to competitions such as Ludum Dare and IFComp, others
have been worked on commercially and with teams. I've previously
designed websites artists and musicians, done research for a number of
universities in Boston, and performed as a contortionist in
Renaissance Faires and circus shows.

I currently live and work in New York City, but am a native of
Satellite Beach, Florida. I've lived in Paris and Berlin with my
spouse, [Alon Levy](https://pedestrianobservations.com/), and went to university and lived near Cambridge, Massachusetts for 10 years. I'm a native English speaker with reading proficiency in French
and conversational proficiency in German. I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science from [Wellesley College](https://cs.wellesley.edu/) in 2011 as an Elizabeth Kaiser Davis Scholar, cross-registering at MIT, Harvard, and Tufts University, with additional coursework at Florida Tech and Massachusetts College of Art.

For fun, I play strategy games, cook and bake vegan food, draw, write, practice circus arts. I'm a classically trained mezzo-soprano and can play and compose on the piano, but rarely have access to a midi keyboard at the right moment.

## Working With Me

I run my own consulting practice and am available for work if the
project seems like a good fit. I charge on a sliding scale, so [drop me a line](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you'd like to talk. 

## Languages

I'm a native English speaker. I learned French and German in high school and university, and can read and speak both to a limited (A1/A2 in CEFR terms) degree. I know a bit of Latin, Hebrew, Spanish, Japanese, and Croatian, but not enough to be useful in a meaningful way.
