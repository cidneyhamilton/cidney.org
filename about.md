## What I Do

I offer technical services to creatives-- musicians, game designers, and other artists.

In some sense I'm retired, since most of the money I've made in my life was working for tech startups in my 20s. I'm deeply critical of the tech industry and prefer to work on projects on my own terms. Right now I'm doing a mixture of consulting and independent game development.

If you'd like to hire me and think we'd be a good fit, use the [contact form](/contact) on this website, or drop me a line at [cidney@cidneyhamilton.com](mailto:cidney@cidneyhamilton.com).

You can see what I'm up to [now](/now), too.

## This Site and Elsewhere

I'm a supporter of the IndieWeb movement, and this is my realtime name. Start here if you want to reach me. I also self-host a Mastodon server to interact with the fediverse, and have semi-defunct accounts on a few corporate social media platforms. You can play some of my games on <a href="{{ site.itch-url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.itch-url }}</a>.
