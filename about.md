## About This Site

This is my realname domain! I've registered it so that other people can't pretend to be me, and that it's easy to contact me. :) It's a very simple static site without much real content. Occasionally I <a href="/blog">post stuff</a>. I am terrible at keeping in touch with people.

I try to redesign it once a year. Right now I'm going with plain text, to make it text-browser friendly and to avoid clutter.

I used to make websites and web apps for a living! I don't really do this any more, since making games is more fun. I barely have time to keep this one up to date. I do some freelance consulting, but mostly for old clients.

## Elsewhere

I host my own <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">mastodon</a> instance, where you can follow me at <a href="{{ site.fedi-url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.fedi-url }}</a>.

I host some of my games, including things for gamejams, at <a href="{{ site.itch-url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.itch-url }}</a>.
