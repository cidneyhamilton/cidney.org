I"<p>I make video games! Mostly with Unity, though I’ve also done some indie stuff with Godot, Inform, or just my own code. I’m a fan of free and open source gamedev tools for narrative design, such as Ink and Twine.</p>

<p>I’m primarily a programmer, but I’ve also done 2D and 3D art, animation, music composition, game design, script writing, sound, voice acting… all the things.</p>

<p>Some commercial games I’ve worked or am working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://kensgame.com">a new secret game with Ken and Roberta Williams</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://summerdazegame.com">Summer Daze at Hero-U</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://hero-u.com">Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My indie stuff is available on <a href="https://cidney.itch.io">itch.io</a></p>
