  My name is <a class="p-name u-url" href="http://localhost:4000"><span class="p-given-name">Cidney</span></a>. I've been a software engineer, graphic designer, and various other roles as needed. I'm a queer vegan Millennial snowflake. I live in the Eastern US with my wife and our housemate and cat.

<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>

<p>This is my realname domain! I’ve registered it so that other people can’t pretend to be me, and that it’s easy to contact me. :) It’s a very simple static site without much real content, though lately I’ve been starting to <a href="/blog">blog</a> about stuff and keep general information.</p>

<h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2>

<p>I don’t use corporate social media. It makes me more mysterious and less prone to distraction. If you’re on the fediverse, I host my own <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">mastodon</a> instance, where you can follow me at <a href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/@cidney" target="_blank">https://social.city-of-glass.net/@cidney</a>. (If you’re not on the fediverse, sign up for an account and follow me anyways; decentralized social media is cool. I host some of my games, including things for gamejams, at <a href="https://cidney.itch.io" target="_blank">https://cidney.itch.io</a>, and some of my source code at <a href="http://git.city-of-glass.net/gitea">my personal git forge</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cidneyhamilton">github for open source stuff</a>.</p>
