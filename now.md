Let me start with the basics.

- I live in Berlin with my partner [Alon](http://pedestrianobservations.com).
- I worked as a software engineer after graduation from college in Boston.
- Right now I do a combination of consulting and indie game development.
- I'm queer and poly. I present femme.
- I'm from Florida's Space Coast. I went to college in Boston.
- I've also lived in Paris and New York.
- I speak German and French, but not very fluently. American foreign language education does not tend to be good. :(

Stuff I'm interested in
- programming
- narrative design
- creative writing
- 2D drawing and painting
- 3D modeling
- interactive fiction
- tabletop RPGs
- vegan cooking/baking
- retro gaming

I'm working on assimilating to living in Germany; designing a game (which I expect to be my main priority for the next couple years), and doing consulting. I'm very busy!
