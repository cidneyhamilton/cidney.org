I moved back to Berlin, this time likely permanently. I have health
insurance and am studying for the B1 Pr√ºfung. 

I have the framework in place for City of Glass, and am working on a
demo of the prologue. I'm actively looking for additional contract
work, ideally in a European time zone.

More here as I know it.
