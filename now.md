I moved back to the Northeast in August! After five years of recovering from a disabling spinal injury and putting some psychological trauma to rest in a gothic horror novel set in my home state of Florida, it was time to move on. I'm adjusting to living in a small space, cooking my own food, and actually being able to get places without a car. It's been a huge adjustment and I'm a little overwhelmed, but things are okay.

The game I was working on with Scott Adams launched in August. An artist I'm friends with has dragged me into working on a new indie project, in collaboration with Steve Alexander of Infamous Quests. I've been working with game industry heavy hitters for the last five years and am feeling a little strange about the whole thing at this point. I'm tentatively looking for more work, so if you need a Unity programmer, please hit me up! 

In a couple days I'm leaving New York to go to [AdventureX](https://adventurexpo.org/), and then going back to Berlin.
