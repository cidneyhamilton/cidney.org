I'm currently working on two indie games: City of Glass (as a solo dev) and Hollywood Brawl with a team. Doing some consulting but mostly trying to get these completed.

Current location: New York City (since 2022)
Current writing project: Elisabeth (novel) and City of Glass game script

Stuff I'm learning:
- Studying for the B1 Pr√ºfung in German
- Technical drawing 
- Godot engine tooling
