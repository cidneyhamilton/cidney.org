Let me start with the basics.

- I do freelance web and game development. Occasionally I find time to do indie dev. :)
- I live with my partner [Alon](http://pedestrianobservations.com).
- I'm queer and poly. I present femme.

Stuff I'm interested in
- programming
- narrative design
- creative writing
- 2D drawing and painting
- 3D modeling
- interactive fiction
- tabletop RPGs
- vegan cooking/baking
- retro gaming

Much of this year has been occupied with moving from the US to Germany, finishing
edits on first book, contract work, and indie game development.
