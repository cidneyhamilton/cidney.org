Let me start with the basics.

- I live in Berlin, DE.
- I founded an indie game studio, Cat and Witch Games, working on an unannounced project.
- I do freelance web and game development.
- I'm working on an adventure game called _Stereotypical_ for a game studio called Clopas.

Long term:
- I'm supportive of the IndieWeb, the Fediverse, and owning my own content
- I've been vegetarian or vegan for most of my life.
- I'm an American trying to get outside a monolingual bubble.
- I speak French and German, but not well.

Stuff I'm interested in
- programming
- interactive fiction
- tabletop RPGs
- vegan cooking/baking
- retro gaming

Much of this year has been occupied with moving from the US to Germany, finishing
edits on first book, contract work, and indie game development.
