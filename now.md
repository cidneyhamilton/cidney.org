I've been handfasted to Cat since November of 2021! We are trying to plan a more public ceremony for this summer.

I had my COVID booster shot in early January. I have had more severe side effects than usual; I'm trying to see a geneticist to rule out vascular EDS, or some combination of both hypermobile and vascular EDS. This is all very frightening, since the average life expectancy with vascular EDS is about 45.

I am currently looking for additional consulting gigs and part-time work; feel free to [get in touch](http://cidney.org/contact)! I am 20,000 words into a new draft of my book and hoping to have it wrapped up by the end of 2022.
