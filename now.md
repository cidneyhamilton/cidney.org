I'm still reeling from the last six months and figuring out where I'm going from here and where to settle down. I've gone through a lot personally and politically. 

Current writing projects:
- Elisabeth (novel)-- in fourth draft, waiting for final revisions
- Sorceress (novella)-- first draft

Games currently in development:
- Hollywood Brawl (lead programmer, art directed by <a href="http://www.eufrasio.com/">Al Eufrasio</a>, designed by <a href="http://www.infamous-quests.com/">Steve Alexander</a>)
- Stereotypical (designed by [Clopas](http://www.clopas.net/)
- City of Glass (solo project; dev blogs here)

I released a short, single-choice Twine game called <a
href="https://cidney.itch.io/flight">Flight</a> earlier this fall, and am on the conference committee for next year's [Narrascope](https://narrascope.org/).
