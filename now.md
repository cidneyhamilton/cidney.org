There's so much going on right now!

In February, I got married (again). My partner lives in Europe, and I'm in the
process of applying for residence permit to live in Germany. We're
renting an apartment together in Berlin. My German is solidly
beginner-level; I had two semesters of German in college, but haven't
used it since until quite recently. I'm hoping to take an A2 course
once things settle down.

Two more games I worked on came out recently-- [Colossal Cave 3D
Adventure](https://www.colossalcave3d.com/), designed by Roberta
Williams, and [Summer Daze: Tilly's
Tale](https://summerdazegame.com/), designed by Corey and Lori
Cole. Both are available on Steam, as well as a variety of other
platforms. I could not talk openly about the projects when they were
in development, and was in the awkward situation of working for my
former boss's former boss at Sierra Online.

Right now I'm finishing up a contract with NYU for the [Transit Costs
Project](https://transitcosts.com/), designing a 3D simulation of what
New York Penn Station could look like if it followed best
practices. I'm also on to a final round of edits for my novel,
_Elisabeth_, which I hope to be able to say more about soon!

On a more serious and political note: Many of my friends and family
are still in Florida, which has become increasingly hostile to the
majority of its inhabitants. I'm often struggling to communicate about
the American healthcare system to people outside the United States
(it's very bad and gets people killed). For those of you following who
are concerned, I highly recommend donating to [Equality
Florida](https://www.eqfl.org/), or more locally the [Space Coast
Progressive Alliance](https://scpaflorida.com/), [Brevard Women's
Center](https://womenscenter.net) (which also serves men and nonbinary
people who've been the victims of domestic violence), and the [Marine
Resources Council](https://savetheirl.org/). I'm still involved with
volunteering for an environmental nonprofit in the area, but on a very
minor basis, and experience a lot of guilt and anguish about
"abandoning" my hometown.
