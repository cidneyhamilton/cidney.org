This is the Jekyll source code and content for my personal website.

## Setup
Install Ruby and RubyGems. Install the gems `jekyll` and `bundler`. `bundle update` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start up a server.

## Known issues

- [ ] No page for category listings (/gamedev, etc)
- [ ] Handle sharing screenshots (Screenshot Saturday, etc)
- [ ] Too much work and personal intertwinedness? Or not enough?
